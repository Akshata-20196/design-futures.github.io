      <p>The studio brings together two seemingly different and yet aligned worlds: Design, and Futures. The studio is a space for exploring multiple paths of inquiry in the intersection of these worlds. What becomes crucial, particularly in the emerging complex contexts of technology and change in India (and elsewhere) is what is the orientation of a designer? How does design reconcile and account for the ways it has evolved historically as an agent of change, deeply concerned about ‘the future’ and yet producing social, economic and ecological inequities?</p>

<p>How does design reconcile for the rapidly evolving technology and ever-growing list of complex challenges in the future? How design and designers change themselves to continue being relevant? Design and Future studio opens up a space for inquiring into these larger questions through enabling a reflective conversation with digital, physical and social materials.</p>
