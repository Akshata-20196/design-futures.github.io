Possible values of `<btype>`: `[feature, bug, hotfix]`
Use `<issue_short_title>` as provided in the corresponding issue.

Protected branches: `main, stable`
`main   : active development branch`

As much as possible, do not add any third-party packages.

Work on your branch and send a Pull Request once done.
